I have completed all the requested modifications to both your `data/game_data.json` and `server/server.js` files, and your server is now running in the background.

**Here's a summary of the implemented changes ready for your testing:**

*   **`data/game_data.json`:**
    *   The `fuel_capacity` values for all your chassis cards have been updated to the values you provided ("4x2": 650, "6x4/2": 500, "6x4": 450, "8x4": 300).
    *   The `compatible_engine_classes` and `compatible_chassis_classes` for "Light", "Medium", and "Heavy" truck models have been updated to reflect the new broader compatibility rules you defined.

*   **`server/server.js`:**
    *   **Trap Card Rules:**
        *   Trap cards will *not* appear in Round 1.
        *   Trap cards *will* appear from Round 2 onwards.
        *   Unused trap cards will disappear from your hand when your turn ends.
        *   Played trap cards will be removed from your hand, and their effects for "Fuel Thief", "Breakdown", and "Police" are now implemented.
    *   **New Fuel Mechanics:**
        *   `player.fuel` is initialized to `0` at the start of the game.
        *   Your Fuel is now calculated and set/added based on the `fuel_capacity` of the chassis cards in your deployed trucks, both for initial setup and replenishment. This calculated value is then sent to the client.
    *   **Compatibility Validation:** The `isCombinationValid` function now includes console logging to output the `compatible_engine_classes`, `engineClass`, `compatible_chassis_classes`, and `chassisClasses` data being used by the server for each combination check.

**Please proceed with the following steps to thoroughly test these changes:**

1.  **Start your client application.**
2.  **Play a game and specifically test:**
    *   **Truck/Part Combinations:** Try combinations that were previously giving "incompatible" messages (e.g., "Light Truck" with "Medium" engine) to see if they are now accepted. **Observe your server's console output** for the compatibility logs from `isCombinationValid` to ensure the server is using the updated rules.
    *   **Fuel Mechanics:**
        *   Check your starting Fuel after deploying your first convoy. It should reflect the sum of your deployed chassis' fuel capacities.
        *   Observe how your Fuel changes during replenishment rounds when you add new chassis.
    *   **Trap Cards:**
        *   Confirm no trap cards in Round 1.
        *   Confirm trap cards appear from Round 2.
        *   Test playing each type of trap card ("Fuel Thief", "Breakdown", "Police") and verify its specific effect (e.g., fuel changes, truck immobilization, truck destruction, truck revelation).
        *   Test ending a turn with an unused trap card in hand to see if it disappears.

Please provide your detailed feedback and any relevant server console logs after testing. If you encounter any unexpected behavior, the logs from the server will be crucial for further debugging.
